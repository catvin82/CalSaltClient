Welcome to Catvin82's CalSaltClient

Here are the instructions:

Step 1:

Run Fabric-Loader and select 1.18.1 Step 2:

go into the %APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods folder by doing Win+R and typing %AppData% in the box, showing hidden files and finding .minecraft and then mods (windows) [~/home/(user)/.minecraft/mods (linux)] and paste the mods there

 (MAKE SURE TO CHECK IF THERE ARE OTHER MODS THERE AND MOVE THEM ELSEWHERE)

 Step 3:

Go into the Minecraft default launcher and select fabric 

Step 4:

Play!!!

NONE OF THIS CODE IS MINE! THIS IS A MODPACK! Go onto curseforge and search each mod's name for the download link and author. Thanks to all these mods' creators!

Have fun using CalSaltClient!
